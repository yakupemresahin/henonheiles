# Source Code for Bachelor Thesis: Chaotic Nature of Physical Systems
## Conservative Chaos and the Hénon-Heiles Hamiltonian

---

## Overview

This repository contains the Python source code developed for the Bachelor's thesis titled "Chaotic Nature of Physical Systems: Conservative Chaos and the Hénon-Heiles Hamiltonian". The code simulates the dynamics of the Hénon-Heiles system, a classical example of a conservative system exhibiting chaotic behavior.

The primary goal of this code is to:
1.  Numerically integrate the equations of motion for the Hénon-Heiles Hamiltonian.
2.  Visualize the system's trajectory in phase space.
3.  Generate Poincaré sections to analyze the transition from regular to chaotic motion as energy increases.
4.  Integrate the variational equations alongside the main trajectory, providing a basis for stability analysis (e.g., Lyapunov exponents, although calculation might not be fully implemented here).
5.  Provide tools for saving and loading simulation results.

## The Hénon-Heiles System

The Hénon-Heiles system describes the motion of a star moving in a non-axisymmetric galactic potential. It's a Hamiltonian system with two degrees of freedom (x, y) and their conjugate momenta (p_x, p_y).

This system is conservative (energy is conserved) and is widely studied as a model for Hamiltonian chaos.

## Features

*   **Phase Space Representation:** Classes to define the system's phase space, variables, and Hamiltonian.
*   **Dynamics:** Set arbitrary dynamics (equations of motion) and variational equations.
*   **Numerical Integration:** Implements the 4th-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method for integrating both the main system and the variational equations.
*   **Energy Conservation:** Includes functions to calculate the Hamiltonian (energy) and potentially set initial conditions based on a target energy.
*   **Poincaré Sections:** Functionality to compute and plot Poincaré sections for a chosen surface (e.g., x=0).
*   **Visualization:** Plotting functions for:
    *   Time evolution of individual variables.
    *   2D phase space projections (e.g., y vs. x, p_y vs. y).
    *   3D phase space projections.
    *   Color-coded plots based on time.
*   **Data Handling:** Save simulation time series (time, phase variables, variational variables) to CSV files. Load existing simulation data.

## Requirements

*   **Python:** Version 3.8 or higher recommended.
*   **Libraries:**
    *   `numpy`
    *   `scipy` (for `fsolve`)
    *   `matplotlib` (for plotting)
    *   `pandas` (for saving/loading CSV data)
    *   `sympy` (for displaying equations using LaTeX)
    *   `IPython` (for `display` and `Latex` functions, primarily useful in Jupyter environments but used here for output)

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [URL of your GitHub repository]
    cd [repository-directory-name]
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
    ```txt
    numpy
    scipy
    matplotlib
    pandas
    sympy
    ipython
    # Add import_ipynb if you keep that specific import and need it
    # import_ipynb
    ```
    Then install:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

The main simulation logic and example usage are found within the chaos_simulation.py

1.  **Configure Simulation:** Open the chaos_simulation.py script. Modify parameters within the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block:
    *   `energy`: The total energy level for the simulation.
    *   `t_total`: The total simulation time.
    *   `dt`: The integration time step.
    *   `initial_conditions`: A list of initial condition templates (often one variable is set to `None` to be determined by the energy constraint).
    *   `output_folder`: The directory where simulation results (CSV files) will be saved.

2.  **Run the Simulation:**
    ```bash
    python chaos_simulation.py
    ```

3.  **Outputs:**
    *   **Console Output:** Progress messages, timing information, potentially initial conditions found.
    *   **Plots:** Matplotlib windows will appear displaying phase space plots, Poincaré sections, etc., as generated by the example code.
    *   **Data Files:** CSV files containing the time series data for each simulation run will be saved in the specified `output_folder` (e.g., `simOuts_example/`). Filenames typically include simulation parameters like energy, time step, and initial conditions.
